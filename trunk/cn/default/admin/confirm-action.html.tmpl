    <p>When you view an administrative form in [% terms.Bugzilla %], a token string
    is randomly generated and stored both in the database and in the form you loaded,
    to make sure that the requested changes are being made as a result of submitting
    a form generated by [% terms.Bugzilla %]. Unfortunately, the token used right now
    is incorrect, meaning that it looks like you didn't come from the right page.
    The following token has been used :</p>

    It looks like you didn't come from the right page (you have no valid token for
    the <em>[% expected_action FILTER html %]</em> action while processing the
    '[% script_name FILTER html%]' script). The reason could be one of:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>您在成功提交修改后，点击了浏览器“后退”按钮。不建议您这样做（但没什么危害）。</li>
      <li>您直接在浏览器的地址栏输入了此链接（应该是安全的）。</li>
      <li>You clicked on a URL which redirected you here <b>without your consent</b>,
      in which case this action is much more critical.</li>
    </ul>
   您仍然要提交这些更改吗？ 也许结果可能能会与您的预期的相悖。
